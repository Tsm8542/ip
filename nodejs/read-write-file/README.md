# 🧾 Node.js File Handling Project

A simple Node.js project demonstrating how to **read**, **write**, and **manage files** using the built-in `fs` (File System) module.  
This example also shows how to properly structure a Node.js project for clean, maintainable file operations.

```
file-handling-nodejs/

│
├─ src/ # Source code folder
│ └─ index.js # Main script for reading and writing files
│
├─ package.json # Node project configuration
└─ README.md # Project documentation
```
