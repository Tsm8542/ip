## Project Overview

This project is a React-based arithmetic calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division) on two numbers. The application demonstrates the use of JSX, React state management, and event handling in a React functional component.

## Features

1. Input two numbers for calculation.
2. Perform Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division operations.
3. Dynamic display of the result using JSX.
4. Handles divide-by-zero errors gracefully.
5. Responsive and interactive UI with simple styling.
